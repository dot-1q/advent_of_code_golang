The various Advent of Code challenges solved in golang.
This was done as a way to learn and get experienced with Go, so the first implementations might not be very idiomatic.

| Year | Done        |

# Notable Challenges
[Day 22 of 2015](2015/day22/twenty-two.go) Implemented Dijkstra's algorithm with a Priority Queue with respect to each game state and its mana spent.

[Day 10 of 2016](2016/day10/ten.go) I'm always happy to make recursion work lol. Plus, browsed reddit and it also wasn't the default solution implemented by the other people.

[Day 11 of 2017](2017/day11/eleven.go) Made a very concise solution for a new grid system (Hexagonal). Made me learn about it. [Hex Grid Information](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons)

[Day 21 of 2017](2017/day21/twenty-one.go) Performed various matrix transformations (rotate and flip). ChatGPT helped me write the Merging algorithm for the matrices.
