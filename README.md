# Advent of Code in Go

![image](aoc_go.png "aoc")

The various Advent of Code challenges solved in golang.
This was done as a way to learn and get experienced with Go, so the first implementations might not be very idiomatic.

| Year | Done        |

# Notable Challenges
[Day 22 of 2015](2015/day22/twenty-two.go) Implemented Dijkstra's algorithm with a Priority Queue with respect to each game state and its mana spent.

[Day 10 of 2016](2016/day10/ten.go) I'm always happy to make recursion work lol. Plus, browsed reddit and it also wasn't the default solution implemented by the other people.
